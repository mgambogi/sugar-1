HACKING
=======

For hacking you can use the sugar-build tool. Sugar is made of several modules and it often depends on libraries which has not yet been packaged in linux distributions. To make it easier for developers to build from sources, we developed a set of scripts that automates builds and other common development tasks. 

For details see: http://sugarlabs.org/~buildbot/docs/build.html
